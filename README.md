    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

To use in Observable,

```javascript
forEach = require( 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/string-for-each@v0.1.0-umd/browser.js' )
```

To vendor stdlib functionality and avoid installing dependency trees for Node.js, you can use the UMD server build:

```javascript
var forEach = require( 'path/to/vendor/umd/string-for-each/index.js' )
```

To include the bundle in a webpage,

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/string-for-each@v0.1.0-umd/browser.js"></script>
```

If no recognized module system is present, access bundle contents via the global scope:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
(function () {
    window.forEach;
})();
</script>
```

#### forEach( str, \[options,] clbk\[, thisArg ] )

Invokes a function for each character in a string.

```javascript
function log( value, index ) {
    console.log( '%d: %s', index, value );
}

forEach( 'Beep!', log );
/* =>
    0: B
    1: e
    2: e
    3: p
    4: !
*/
```

The invoked function is provided three arguments:

-   **value**: character.
-   **index**: starting character index.
-   **str**: input string.

To set the function execution context, provide a `thisArg`.

```javascript
function clbk() {
    this.count += 1;
}

var str = 'Hello, world!';

var ctx = {
    'count': 0
};

forEach( str, clbk, ctx );

var bool = ( str.length === ctx.count );
// returns true
```

The function supports the following options:

-   **mode**: type of characters over which to iterate. Must be one of the following:

    -   `'grapheme'`: grapheme clusters. Appropriate for strings containing visual characters which can span multiple Unicode code points (e.g., emoji).
    -   `'code_point'`: Unicode code points. Appropriate for strings containing visual characters which are comprised of more than one Unicode code unit (e.g., ideographic symbols and punctuation and mathematical alphanumerics).
    -   `'code_unit'`: UTF-16 code units. Appropriate for strings containing visual characters drawn from the basic multilingual plane (BMP) (e.g., common characters, such as those from the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets).
    
    Default: `'grapheme'`.

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   By default, the function assumes the general case in which an input string may contain an arbitrary number of grapheme clusters. This assumption comes with a performance cost. Accordingly, if an input string is known to only contain visual characters of a particular type (e.g., only alphanumeric), one can achieve better performance by specifying the appropriate `mode` option.
